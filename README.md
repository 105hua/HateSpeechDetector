# HateSpeechDetector - A Paper Plugin

## Description

HateSpeechDetector is Work-In-Progress (WIP) is a plugin for the Paper Software. The plugin works through
analyzing Chat Messages through [Fuk.ai](https://fuk.ai/), an AI Hate Speech and Profanity Detection API to
determine whether the aforementioned contains Hate Speech. If the plugin detects that a message contains
hate speech, then it will prevent the message from being broadcast to other players, otherwise, the message
will appear as normal.
